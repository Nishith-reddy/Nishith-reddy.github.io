### Decoding Super Bowl Ad Popularity features

Analyzed a dataset of ads from 10 brands and predicted ad popularity using a fine-tuned random forest model and found out the key features for popular ads include animals, sex appeal, and humor.

We are seeking to find out what the driving force is behind the popularity of Super Bowl
commercials. The Super Bowl provides an opportunity for brands to promote their products with
unique and often over-the-top commercials, so we want to discover what the defining
characteristics are for a successful Super Bowl ad.

Brands pay millions of dollars for an ad during Super Bowl commercial breaks, and a
significant portion of viewers enjoy the commercials just as much as the actual sporting event.
Viewers often rank their favorite commercials and brands can truly make significant profits if
they can put out a hit commercial. Thus, it is valuable to see which combination of absurdity,
hilarity, danger, sex appeal, etc. enthralls the most viewers.

Our dataset consists of 247 advertisements from the 10 brands that aired the most
commercials this century. Each row represents a different advertisement. Columns describe
different variables relating to each advertisement. Variables range from binary descriptors (funny,
patriotic, etc.) to video performance and descriptors (view count, like count, comment count,
video title, channel title).
