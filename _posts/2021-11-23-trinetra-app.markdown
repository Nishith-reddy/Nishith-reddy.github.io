# Trinetra App: A Companion for the Blind

The life of a blind person is always dependent on another person who needs some kind of assistance, whether it is mobility or any other chore. Just like any other normal person, the blind should be able to lead their life. Trinetra App- a companion for the blind is aimed to provide a better experience for the blind. Trinetra App helps blind people by interacting with them and can tell what is happening around them. The design is incorporated with cutting-edge technologies like computer vision, speech recognition, image processing, and OCR. Trinetra App is designed using Flutter Framework which can run on both Android OS and IOS. Trinetra App can find objects in front of the user, recognize text, and convey information like time, weather, phone battery level. The detected and recognized results are conveyed through audio to the user. This research work details the methods used for design and implementation and experimental results thus obtained.
