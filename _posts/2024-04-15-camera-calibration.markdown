Calibrated a laptop's webcam on a checkerboard pattern and overlaid virtual reality objects, such as a house, onto the checkerboard.

This project deals with calibrating a camera and using the calibrated camera to place some
virtual objects on the target image. For most parts of this project, a checkerboard is used as
the target image. The implementation of this project is done in C++.
