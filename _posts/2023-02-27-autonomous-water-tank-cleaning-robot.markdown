# Design and Simulation of Autonomous Water Tank Cleaning robot in Gazebo

Designed to address the drawbacks of traditional water storage tank cleaning procedures, a new robot system is described in this paper for performing cleaning work instead of manual cleaning which is characteristic of low efficiency, low safety, long time, and water pollution problems. In this paper, we have described a robot system that can clean both the floor and walls of the water tank. The robot is designed in Fusion 360, and it is simulated in Gazebo by creating an environment of a water tank. For autonomous functionality, programs written in Robot Operating System (ROS) are employed.
