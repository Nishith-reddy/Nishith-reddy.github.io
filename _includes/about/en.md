Hey, I am Nishith Reddy. A Data science graduate student at Northeastern University Boston, MA. I have developed projects involving LLMs, MLops, and Computer Vision.

I always find it fascinating to analyze a dataset, identify relationships between different features in the data, and apply machine learning models to the cleaned dataset in order to provide an answer to the research question.

I am currently working as a data science intern at [Crewasis](https://crewasis.ai)
